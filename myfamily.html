    	<p> There is nothing more important to me than my family. My parents, Alyssa and Steven, are both 49 years old. I am the oldest child of the family. I have two sisters, Jill and Danielle, who are 19 and 12 years old. My brother Ryan is 16 years old. I have a very special and unique relationship with each one of my family members.</p>
